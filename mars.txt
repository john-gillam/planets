some super cool things regarding planets!
Possibly -- or not -- including comments from Dracula to the Wolfman.
Cold or dry, but everything is my favourite color

The two moons (of mars?) may be a problem for the wolfman!

Crazy - this bizzle is crizzle CRAZY!!!!!

Some other things that I can put in here ... I am adding the content

For instance -- the mummy would appreciate the dry atmosphere here (remember it is all about monsters on mars)

But freaking cold yo!!
